## Project Overview
The project aims to gather insights from the Starbucks Customer dataset containing the demographics, offer interactions associated with the product and transaction details. As described in the project proposal, It is indispensable for any organization that works on a B2C model to acquire more & more insights from the data of the current customer base. These insights in return help to identify the spending habits of a specific demographic segment and  target certain demographics with tailored ads/offers to maximize revenue and conversion rate (those customers who made a purchase after viewing the ads/offers). 

Apart from the ML model, I have also created a web App. While, it's still under active development, feel free to check it out [here](https://dry-springs-01713.herokuapp.com/).
